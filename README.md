# rong

### RÃ¶ng - Old Norse for hull (frame of ship's hull)

Rong is a simple, lightweight SCSS framework. Very much a work in progress.

Full documentation coming soon.

## Building

Install `gulp-cli` globally:

```
npm install -g gulp-cli
```

Install the development dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Now you can run `gulp` to produce `dist/rong.css`, or use `gulp production` to
produce a minified version.
